## Amazoogle Challenge Lab

This project is a sports recruitment enhancer. This app helps basketball recruiters find their optimal players to onboard, reducing the amount of time, money, and resources needed to create an effective team. Initial prototype is done on NCAA basketball data because the data is public.

We analyze the 2018-2019 Pac 12 basketball teams as a proof of concept. From here, it can be extrapolated to the every season of every league of every sport in every sport. Additionally, this is optimizing team building based on quantifiable criteria, which can also be transferable to other team-related industries.
